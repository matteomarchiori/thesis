    One of the most discussed topics in distributed systems is the leader election among a group of peers.
    As discussed during lesson (\href{https://www.math.unipd.it/~tullio/SCD/2020/Material/L18.pdf}{\texttt{Vardanega slides}}) having a leader in a distributed application is useful to perform the status replication of the distributed system.
    Employed algorithms to obtain a leader in a distributed system are known as distributed consensus algorithms.
    Nowadays the three most used distributed consensus algorithms are Paxos, Zab and Raft, implemented and used in different platforms.
    The aim of this project is to explore the differences among these algorithms and get a view under the hood of Zab in ZooKeeper.
    The explanation of the algorithms is useful to understand pros and cons of each one and what are their main features.
    The proof of concept is a demo of Zab algorithm implemented on top of ZooKeeper, in order to get a demonstration on how the algorithm works and to try the ZooKeeper platform.
