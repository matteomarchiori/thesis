\chapter{Problem statement\label{sec:problem}}

\section{Scope\label{sec:scope}}
The aim of the PoC is to understand in practice how the Zab algorithm works.
So the boundaries are set by how the algorithm is described in \cite{junqueira2011zab} and how can it be implemented in a programming language such as Java.
The most used implementation of Zab is not exactly as described in the original paper (more details can be found in \cite{medeiros2012zookeeper}) and it is enclosed inside the ZooKeeper system.

\section{Purpose\label{sec:purpose}}
The expectations from this work are to check if Zab can be easily reproduced as described in the original paper.
Starting from here, scientific expectation is to understand if the atomic broadcast properties can be respected.

\section{Aspects to be investigated\label{sec:aspects}}

Investigated aspects are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item how to implement a demo of how Zab should work;
    \item try ZooKeeper platform to manage clients;
    \item understand how Zab is implemented under the hood.
\end{itemize}
